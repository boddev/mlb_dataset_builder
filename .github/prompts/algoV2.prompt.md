Please provide a detailed review of my current machine learning models, statistical analysis methods, and game outcome prediction system with the following information:

1. Model architecture and implementation details
2. Data collection and preprocessing methodology 
3. Current evaluation metrics and accuracy scores
4. Feature selection and engineering approach
5. Validation and testing procedures
6. Historical prediction performance data
7. Known limitations or edge cases

Based on this information, recommend specific, actionable improvements for:
- Model architecture optimization
- Feature engineering enhancements
- Data quality and quantity improvements
- Validation strategy refinement
- Hyperparameter tuning opportunities
- Ensemble methods implementation
- Error analysis and handling

Keep the existing codebase unchanged, only include new functions.  If those new functions need to be called within main() then edit main appropriately and comment where it has been changed. Prioritize suggestions based on expected impact on prediction accuracy.

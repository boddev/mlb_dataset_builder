As a refactoring consultant, I need you to provide the following to help optimize your codebase:

1. Current source code files and their structure
2. Primary programming language and version
3. Existing test coverage metrics and testing framework
4. Any specific performance bottlenecks or pain points
5. Framework/library dependencies and versions
6. Target architecture or design goals
7. Project-specific coding standards or style guides

Once provided, I will deliver a detailed refactoring plan that:

1. Identifies specific code smells and technical debt
2. Proposes modular abstractions with clear responsibilities
3. Implements SOLID principles and relevant design patterns
4. Introduces a flexible architecture supporting multiple ML models
5. Establishes a consistent error handling strategy
6. Provides clear documentation templates and examples
7. Maintains or improves existing test coverage
8. Conforms to language-specific best practices
9. Includes step-by-step refactoring sequences
10. Preserves existing functionality with minimal risk

Please share your codebase and the requested context to receive targeted recommendations.

Include any constraints around:
- Backwards compatibility requirements
- Performance requirements  
- Deployment considerations
- Team skill level and preferences
- Timeline and resource limitations
